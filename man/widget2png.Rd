\description{
Make a static png file for an htmlwidget
}
\details{
This uses phantomjs (\url{https://phantomjs.org}) to render your htmlwidget in a headless browser and take a screenshot of it, creating a static output.  This assumes that phantomjs has been installed on your machine and is available as a system call.  For plots that take longer to load and render, you may need to increase the value of \code{timeout}.  Note that this function is experimental.
